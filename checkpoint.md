# Creatify API TypeScript Library

## Current Status - May 17, 2025

I've examined the current implementation of the Creatify API TypeScript library. Here's what I've found:

### Current Implementation Overview

1. **Core API Client**:
   - Implemented using axios for HTTP requests
   - Proper authentication with API ID and key
   - Error handling with detailed error information
   - Support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods

2. **API Modules**:
   - Avatar API - for AI avatar video creation (getAvatars, getVoices, createLipsync, etc.)
   - URL-to-Video API - for converting web content to videos
   - Text-to-Speech API - for generating audio from text
   - AI Editing API - for automated video editing
   - Custom Templates API - for creating videos with templates
   - DYOA (Design Your Own Avatar) API - for designing custom avatars

3. **Utility Classes**:
   - VideoCreator - simplified interface for avatar video creation
   - AudioProcessor - for audio generation (text-to-speech)
   - BatchProcessor - for handling multiple API tasks

4. **Type Definitions**:
   - Comprehensive TypeScript types for all API parameters and responses
   - Namespaced by API module (Avatar, UrlToVideo, TextToSpeech, etc.)

5. **Testing**:
   - Tests implemented using Vitest (converted from Jest)
   - Tests for API client, API modules, and utility classes
   - Mock responses for API testing

### Current Plan

Based on the current status and the latest checkpoint, the next steps should be:

1. Run the test suite to verify all components are working correctly
2. Debug any test failures
3. Run an example file to confirm library functionality
4. Build the library for distribution
5. Verify the build output
6. Update the package.json version to 1.0.0

Let me proceed with these tasks to ensure the library is working correctly and ready for distribution.

## Next Steps

1. First, I'll run the tests to verify that everything is working correctly:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. Then I'll check an example file to confirm the library functionality:
   ```bash
   # Modify an example with valid API credentials for testing
   # Run the example
   npx ts-node examples/simplified-video-creation.ts
   ```

3. Build the library:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Verify the build output in the dist directory
5. Update package.json version to 1.0.0
6. Prepare for package publishing (if required)

I'll update this checkpoint as I complete each task.
