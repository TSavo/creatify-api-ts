# Creatify API TypeScript Library

## Current Status - May 17, 2025

I've completed a QA review of the project, specifically focusing on the Lipsync v2 API functionality and what happens when providing API keys to the library.

### Lipsync v2 API QA Analysis

#### What Happens When Providing API Keys for Lipsync v2

1. **Authentication Process**:
   - When initializing the Creatify client with your API keys (`apiId` and `apiKey`), the keys are stored in the client instance and added to every API request as headers:
     - `X-API-ID`: Your API ID from Creatify
     - `X-API-KEY`: Your API key from Creatify
   - The keys are sent with every HTTP request to authenticate your account

2. **Security Implications**:
   - The API keys provide full access to your Creatify account
   - Keys are stored in memory but aren't persisted to disk by the library itself
   - All API requests are made over HTTPS to `https://api.creatify.ai` (by default)
   - The library doesn't implement any additional encryption for the API keys beyond HTTPS

3. **Credit Usage**:
   - When generating videos with Lipsync v2, your Creatify account will be charged credits
   - The number of credits used is returned in the API response (`credits_used` field)
   - There's no built-in credit limit checking in the library itself

#### Lipsync v2 API Flow

When using the Lipsync v2 API with your API keys, the following happens:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```typescript
   const creatify = new Creatify({
     apiId: 'your-api-id',
     apiKey: 'your-api-key',
   });
   ```

2. **Creating a Lipsync v2 Task**:
   - You submit a request with avatar IDs, voice IDs, scripts, background images, and other parameters
   - The library makes a POST request to `/api/lipsyncs_v2/` with your API keys
   - The Creatify server validates your API keys and creates a video generation task
   - You receive a task ID and initial status (typically 'pending')

3. **Task Processing**:
   - The video generation runs asynchronously on Creatify's servers
   - You need to poll for completion using the `getLipsyncV2` method
   - The server processes your request through various stages: pending → in_queue → running → done (or error)
   - Processing typically takes several minutes depending on video length and complexity

4. **Result Retrieval**:
   - When the task is complete, you receive a URL to the generated MP4 video
   - The video is hosted on Creatify's servers or their CDN
   - Additional metadata is returned, including credits used, duration, and thumbnail URL

### API Testing Results

I examined the LipsyncV2Api implementation and found:

1. **API Implementation**:
   - The Lipsync v2 API is fully implemented in the library
   - Methods available:
     - `createLipsyncV2`: Creates a new Lipsync v2 task
     - `getLipsyncV2`: Gets the status of a Lipsync v2 task
     - `getLipsyncsV2`: Lists all Lipsync v2 tasks
     - `generateLipsyncV2Preview`: Generates a preview of a Lipsync v2 task
     - `renderLipsyncV2`: Renders a Lipsync v2 task
     - `createAndWaitForLipsyncV2`: Convenience method that creates a task and polls until completion

2. **Error Handling**:
   - The API methods include error handling and logging
   - Failed requests return structured error responses
   - The polling mechanism has timeouts and maximum attempt limits

3. **Required Parameters**:
   - Lipsync v2 requires an array of `video_inputs` and an `aspect_ratio`
   - Each `video_input` must specify:
     - `character`: Avatar ID and style
     - `voice`: Text to speak and voice ID
     - `background`: Background image URL
     - (Optional) `caption_setting`: Style and position of captions

### Security and Privacy Considerations

1. **API Key Exposure Risk**:
   - API keys should not be hardcoded in client-side code
   - For browser usage, consider using a backend proxy or service
   - For server-side usage, store API keys in environment variables

2. **Content Security**:
   - Videos generated with your API keys are associated with your account
   - Background URLs must be accessible to Creatify's servers
   - Generated content is subject to Creatify's terms of service

3. **Rate Limiting and Quotas**:
   - The library doesn't implement rate limiting
   - Excessive requests might be throttled by Creatify's servers
   - Account credit monitoring should be implemented separately

### Recommendations

1. **Secure API Key Management**:
   - Store API keys in environment variables (e.g., .env files with dotenv)
   - For production applications, use a secrets management service
   - Implement a backend proxy for browser-based applications

2. **Robust Error Handling**:
   - Implement more comprehensive error handling in your application
   - Consider adding retry logic for transient errors
   - Monitor credit usage to avoid unexpected charges

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use the `createAndWaitForLipsyncV2` method for simple use cases
   - For better UX, implement a webhook endpoint to receive task completion notifications
   - Consider showing a preview while the full video renders

4. **Testing Approach**:
   - Start with the lowest-cost operations to verify API connectivity
   - Use test accounts with limited credits for development
   - Mock API responses during unit testing to avoid credit usage

### Implementation Changes

1. **AspectRatio Type Enhancement**:
   - Extended the AspectRatio type to support both colon format ('16:9') and 'x' format ('16x9')
   - Added documentation note explaining the dual format support

2. **Response Interface Improvements**:
   - Added missing fields to LipsyncResultResponse (video_thumbnail, credits_used, progress, etc.)
   - Added alternative field name support in VideoResultResponse (both output and video_output)
   - Updated status enums to include all possible values from the API

3. **Documentation URL Standardization**:
   - Updated all documentation URLs to use the consistent base URL `https://creatify.mintlify.app/`
   - Fixed specific endpoint references to point to the correct documentation pages

### Testing

All tests are passing with the updated type definitions and documentation references. The changes were made in a backward-compatible way to ensure existing code continues to work correctly.
