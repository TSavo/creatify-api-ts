# Creatify API TypeScript Library

## Current Status - May 17, 2025

I've completed a QA review of the project, comparing the API implementation against the documentation. All tests are now passing.

### API Documentation vs Implementation Analysis

After examining the codebase and documentation, I identified and fixed several inconsistencies:

1. **URL Inconsistencies**:
   - Documentation URLs in JSDoc comments were inconsistent, using both `https://creatify.mintlify.app/` and `https://docs.creatify.ai/`
   - Standardized all documentation URLs to use `https://creatify.mintlify.app/`
   - Updated specific endpoint references to match the actual documentation structure

2. **Type Inconsistencies**:
   - AspectRatio type was defined as using colon format ('16:9') but the API documentation showed 'x' format ('16x9')
   - Updated AspectRatio type to support both formats: '16:9' and '16x9'
   - Fixed status enum inconsistencies across multiple response types to include all possible values returned by the API

3. **Response Structure Inconsistencies**:
   - Added missing fields to response interfaces to match the documented API responses
   - Fixed field name inconsistencies (e.g., `video_output` vs `output` in VideoResultResponse)
   - Enhanced documentation comments to clarify alternative field names

4. **Documentation Link Issues**:
   - Updated all JSDoc references to point to the correct documentation URLs
   - Fixed specific endpoint references to match the actual API documentation structure

### Implementation Changes

1. **AspectRatio Type Enhancement**:
   - Extended the AspectRatio type to support both colon format ('16:9') and 'x' format ('16x9')
   - Added documentation note explaining the dual format support

2. **Response Interface Improvements**:
   - Added missing fields to LipsyncResultResponse (video_thumbnail, credits_used, progress, etc.)
   - Added alternative field name support in VideoResultResponse (both output and video_output)
   - Updated status enums to include all possible values from the API

3. **Documentation URL Standardization**:
   - Updated all documentation URLs to use the consistent base URL `https://creatify.mintlify.app/`
   - Fixed specific endpoint references to point to the correct documentation pages

### Testing

All tests are passing with the updated type definitions and documentation references. The changes were made in a backward-compatible way to ensure existing code continues to work correctly.

### Missing API Implementations

After comparing the current implementation with the Creatify API documentation, I identified several APIs that are not yet implemented in the library:

1. **AI Shorts API**:
   - The API for converting text to viral videos is not implemented
   - Endpoints include creating AI Shorts tasks, generating previews, rendering videos, and retrieving results

2. **AI Scripts API**:
   - The API for generating AI-driven scripts is not implemented
   - Endpoints include creating AI Scripts, retrieving script items, and getting script details by ID

3. **Musics API**:
   - The API for accessing music categories and music tracks is not implemented
   - Endpoints include getting music categories and retrieving music tracks

4. **Workspace API**:
   - The API for workspace-related operations is not implemented
   - Currently only includes the endpoint for getting remaining credits

5. **Lipsyncs v2 API**:
   - While the multi-avatar lipsync functionality is implemented, the dedicated v2 API endpoints are not
   - The documentation notes that the multi-avatar endpoint is deprecated in favor of the v2 API

### Future Recommendations

1. **Standardize Aspect Ratio Format**: Consider standardizing on either colon format ('16:9') or 'x' format ('16x9') in future versions
2. **Enhance Type Safety**: Add more specific types for status enums and other string literals
3. **Improve Documentation**: Add more examples and clarify alternative field names in the documentation
4. **Implement Missing APIs**: Add support for AI Shorts, AI Scripts, Musics, Workspace, and Lipsyncs v2 APIs
5. **Update Deprecated Implementations**: Replace the deprecated multi-avatar lipsync implementation with the v2 API
6. **Add Preview and Render Methods**: Implement the preview and render methods available in several APIs (Lipsyncs, AI Shorts, AI Editing, Custom Templates)
