# Creatify API TypeScript Library

## Current Status - May 22, 2025

I'm implementing a blog-to-video marketing pipeline for the horizon-city-stories project, integrating the Creatify API for avatar video generation. The pipeline uses a state machine architecture with full bidirectional navigation. We're building on the lessons learned from the creatify-web prototype but implementing everything fresh in a more robust architecture.

## Previous Status - May 17, 2025

I've enhanced the implementation of the LipsyncV2 integration for the Creatify web application and fixed the VoiceInfo type definitions to correctly handle the nested structure of the API responses. Here are the key improvements:

### Recent Improvements

1. **Fixed Voice API Types**:
   - Updated `VoiceInfo` interface to handle both direct properties and nested `accents` array
   - Added proper typing for `AccentInfo` to handle the nested structure
   - Made fields optional where appropriate to accommodate variations in API responses
   - Added fallbacks to ensure consistent field access regardless of API response format

2. **Enhanced Avatar API Implementation**:
   - Improved `getVoices()` method to normalize the data structure
   - Added consistent ID access using both `id` and `voice_id` fields
   - Improved preview URL extraction from nested structures
   - Better error handling and fallbacks for missing properties

3. **Job Queue System**: 
   - Created a simple producer-consumer pattern using a job queue
   - Jobs are stored as files in the `data/jobs` directory
   - Background worker processes jobs asynchronously
   - Non-blocking API responses for long-running operations

4. **Server-Side API Endpoints**: 
   - Enhanced `/api/dev/generate-video` to immediately return a job ID
   - Added `/api/dev/video-status/[jobId]` endpoint to check job status
   - Server utilizes the creatify-api-ts library in a separate process
   - Videos saved to `/public/videos/` directory when complete

5. **Video Generation UI**: 
   - Updated to support asynchronous video generation
   - Polls job status at regular intervals
   - Shows progress updates based on job status
   - Displays completed video when ready

### Technical Approach

1. **Robust API Type Definitions**:
   - All interfaces now properly reflect actual API response structures
   - Optional fields added where appropriate to handle variations
   - Added support for alternative property names (id/voice_id)
   - Improved compatibility between the library and web application

2. **Better Data Normalization**:
   - Library now handles normalizing complex nested data structures
   - Consistent property access regardless of API response format
   - Fallback values for missing properties
   - Preview URL extraction from various possible locations

3. **Producer-Consumer Pattern for Video Generation**:
   - Client submits job → API creates job → Worker processes job
   - Jobs are processed one at a time in a background thread
   - Status updates are persisted to the filesystem
   - Client polls for completion

```

### Current Implementation: Blog-to-Video Pipeline

1. **Architecture**:
   - State machine with proper transition validation
   - Bidirectional navigation allowing users to restart from any previous state
   - State persistence across sessions with audit trail
   - Composable state handlers for each pipeline stage

2. **Pipeline Flow**:
   - BlogSelected → ScriptGenerating → ScriptGenerated → ScriptApproved → AvatarGenerating → AvatarGenerated → AutoComposing → AutoComposed → FinalApproved → ReadyForPublishing

3. **Key Integrations**:
   - Ollama/DeepSeek-R1:7b for AI script generation with cyberpunk framing
   - creatify-api-ts for avatar video generation using LipsyncV2 API
   - Existing AutomaticVideoComposer for adding branding (intro/outro/overlays)

### Implementation Progress

1. **Completed**:
   - Architecture design and state machine planning
   - Analysis of creatify-web prototype patterns for reuse
   - Understanding of creatify-api-ts integration patterns

2. **In Progress**:
   - PipelineStateMachine.ts implementation with transition validation
   - State handlers for Script, Avatar, and Composition stages
   - UI components that respond to state changes

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Complete state persistence and history tracking
   - Integrate Ollama/DeepSeek for script generation
   - Implement AvatarGeneratorStateHandler with creatify-api-ts

### Future Improvements

1. **Further Type Enhancements**:
   - Add more comprehensive documentation for complex API structures
   - Create utility types for common response patterns
   - Add runtime type validation for API responses
   - Improve error handling with specific error types

2. **Scalability**:
   - Implement a proper database for job storage instead of the filesystem
   - Add multiple workers for parallel processing
   - Add job priorities and queue management

3. **Resilience**:
   - Add automatic retries for failed jobs
   - Implement job cleanup for completed or stale jobs
   - Add timeout handling for long-running operations

4. **UX Enhancements**:
   - Add real-time progress updates (WebSockets or Server-Sent Events)
   - Allow job cancellation
   - Add job history and management UI

### Conclusion

The enhanced implementation provides more robust type definitions that accurately reflect the actual API response structure. The VoiceInfo interface now properly handles both direct properties and the nested accents array, with proper optional fields and type definitions. The Avatar API implementation has been improved to normalize the complex data structure, ensuring consistent property access regardless of API response format.
