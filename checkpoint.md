# Creatify API TypeScript Library

## Current Status - May 17, 2025

I've completed the implementation of the LipsyncV2 integration for the Creatify web application. Here's what has been implemented:

### Implementation Summary

1. **Server-Side API Endpoint**: 
   - Created `/api/dev/generate-video` endpoint that:
     - Properly utilizes the creatify-api-ts library on the server side
     - Accepts character configuration and script input
     - Calls the Creatify LipsyncV2 API to generate videos
     - Downloads the resulting videos to `/public/videos/` directory
     - Returns metadata including local file path and video information

2. **Video Generation UI**: 
   - Built a `/video-generator` page that:
     - Loads saved character configurations from the server
     - Allows users to select a character and enter a script
     - Shows a progress indicator during video generation
     - Displays the generated video with playback controls
     - Provides information about the video (ID, credits used, etc.)

3. **Character Configuration System**:
   - Implemented local storage of character configurations in `/data/character-config.json`
   - Added API endpoints to retrieve and update the configurations
   - Enhanced the avatar tool with the ability to save configurations

4. **File System Integration**:
   - Created a `/public/videos` directory for storing generated videos
   - Implemented file downloading and saving from Creatify API
   - Generated unique filenames using UUID to prevent collisions

### Technical Approach

1. **Security**:
   - API credentials stored securely in environment variables
   - All API calls handled server-side to protect credentials
   - No exposure of sensitive information to the client

2. **Video Generation Process**:
   - User selects a character and enters a script on the client
   - Request sent to server-side API endpoint
   - Server uses creatify-api-ts library with API credentials
   - Server polls until video generation completes
   - Server downloads the video to local filesystem
   - Local URL returned to the client for display

3. **Data Flow**:
   - Character configurations stored in server-side JSON file
   - Videos downloaded and stored on server filesystem
   - Public URLs served to client for video playback

### Key Aspects of the Implementation

1. **Proper Use of creatify-api-ts Library**:
   - Imported and used directly in the server-side API endpoint
   - Utilizing the typed interfaces provided by the library
   - Server-side API credentials management

2. **Server-Side Processing**:
   - All video generation and file handling done on the server
   - No client-side API credential exposure
   - Proper error handling and status reporting

3. **Clean Separation of Concerns**:
   - Client-side UI for user interaction
   - Server-side API for business logic and API integration
   - File system operations isolated to the server

### Future Improvements

1. **Video Management**:
   - Add video listing and management interface
   - Implement cleanup of old videos to save disk space
   - Add video metadata storage

2. **Error Handling and Resilience**:
   - Implement more robust error handling
   - Add retry mechanisms for API failures
   - Improve timeout handling for long-running operations

3. **UX Enhancements**:
   - Add real-time progress updates from the Creatify API
   - Implement video previews while generation is in progress
   - Add more customization options (backgrounds, styles, etc.)

### Conclusion

The implementation successfully connects the avatar-voice pairing tool with the LipsyncV2 API to generate MP4 videos. The videos are saved on the filesystem under `/public/videos` and are accessible through the web interface. The system now provides a complete end-to-end workflow for creating AI avatar videos with custom scripts.

Next steps would be to test the implementation thoroughly and make any necessary refinements based on user feedback.
